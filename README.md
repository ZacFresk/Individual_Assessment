# Individual_Assessment
 This was a fun but challenging class. I learned many new skills with a bunch of different programs.
 I also made a lot of friends along the way.

 I'm happy to have learned extensively with:
  - Excel
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - MatPlotLib
  - Numpy
  - SciPy
  - SQL
  - TensorFlow
  - Scikit
  - Tableau

This is all and more of what I could have asked to have learned from this class. I am very gratful for the oporunity to have been a part of such a great community.
